**Outline**

1. Download and prepare data
* Open and examine file contents
* Preprocessing of data
2. Train and test model 
* Predicted reserves for region 1
* Predicted reserves for region 2
* Predicted reserves for region 3
* Analysis of results
3. Prepare for profit calculations
* Establish break even point
4. Calculate profit from selected oil wells and model predictions
* Mean of top 200 highest predicted well reserves, by region
* Calculate total profits from top 200 well predictions
5. Analysis of risk and profits from each region
* Distribution of profits with boostrapped samples from each region
* Risk of losses for each region

**Objective** 
Recommend a region for oil development based on oil sample data from three regions. Build a model to predict the region with the highest profit margin, and analyze risks.
