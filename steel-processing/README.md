
## Outline
1. Import/review data
2. Preprocessing
- Preprocessing and feature engineering of individual datasets
  - Eliminate unecessary parameters, change datatypes, feature extraction
- Join datasets together, final preprocessing of full dataset
  - Imputations, further feature extraction
3. EDA
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and interpret
- Reduce multicollinearity
4. Model training
- Dummy (baseline) model
- Linear Regression model
- Random Forest Regression model
- CatBoost model
5. Final testing of best performing models
6. Interpretation of results and conclusion

## Objective
Predict temperature while processing steel to reduce energy consumption and optimize production costs
